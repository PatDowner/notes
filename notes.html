  <h1>Thursday, Sept 10, 2020</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>So far we had been using JawsDB to deploy on Heroku ... that's only for MySQL</li>
    <li>So you use Atlas instead</li>
    <li><b>Steps to deploy via Atlas</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Under clusters, click collections</li>
      <li>Grey, add my own data</li>
      <li>DB name and collection name</li>
      <li>plus sign for other collections</li>
      <li>Then go to Heroku</li>
      <ul>
        <li>VS Code, commit --> push to github --> Heroku create</li>
        <li>Heroku Site: settings page --> reveal config bars --> config vars --> MONGODB_URI</li>
        <li>In atlas, in DB, click connect in top right (note: be sure you're in the overview tab) --> connect existing
          application --> copy connection string in box --> paste into box next to the MONGODB_URI. But you need your
          atlas username:password</li>
      </ul>
      <li>index.js db, do process.env.MONGODB_URI || 'mongodb://localhost/todo_db</li>
      <li>instead of 3000 in server.js do: process.env.PORT || 3000</li>
      <li>commit code --> push to github --> push to Heroku</li>
    </ul>
    <li>at that point you can test things in postman will also show up in Atlas</li>


    <li><b><u>User Authentication</u></b></li>
    <li>Algorithms create randomized (which is actually programatically created, so it's unique to your exact entered
      password) password from the one you use</li>
    <li>The generated "random" password is called a hash. Usually 300ish characters which make it very secure</li>
    <li>So you log in with "hotdog" it creates "xxxxxRANDOMpasswordxxxx". Then on subsequent log ins it does the same
      thing and if you entered the password correctly they'll match</li>
    <li>It also creates a "salt" that is 50ish characters that they tag onto the end of the "hash" to add even more
      security</li>
    <li>Don't worry, there's an existing system that makes these strong algorithms</li>
    <li>So how do you lock parts of the app until you're logged in correctly? You lock your routes. AKA: authorization
    </li>
    <li>"User presence" lets user stay logged in as they navigate from page to page. Utilizes local storage. You get an
      ID (short string) from which you create a TOKEN which is another (shorter, 20ish characters) randomized string of
      text</li>
    <li><b><a href="http://www.passportjs.org/">Passport</a></b></li>
    <li>It's middleware (steps between front end and back end</li>
    <li>There's numerous strategies (methods) for log ins. Due to time, we're gonna learn the easiest but least
      interesting one (<a href="http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-local/"><b>passport-local</b></a>). But
      there's others that are really cool (log in via FB for example)</li>
    <li>Also need a plug in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-local-mongoose">passport-local-mongoose</a>
      and <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-jwt/">passport-jwt</a> (JWT = json web token) and <a
        href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken">jsonwebtoken</a></li>

  <ul>
    <li>Access mongo terminal via: C: Program Files/ MongoDB/Server/4.4/bin/mongo</li>
    <li><a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/crud/">basic Mongo crud operations</a></li>
    <li>show dbs</li>
    <li>"use xxx_db" --- creates and lets you use a db all at once. Well, sorta. Schrodinger's db</li>
    <li>similarly you can just jump right in with "db.dogs.insert(...." and it creates the dogs collection</li>
    <li>"show collections" will bring up dogs</li>
    <li>"db.dogs.find()" ==== shows all</li>
    <li>"db.dogs.remove({ "name": "John" })" removes dog named John.</li>
    <li>"db.dogs.update({ "name": "Beef" }, { $set: { age: 3 } })" changes Beef's age to 3.</li>
    <li>Favorites activity....again!!! (for the last time)</li>

    <li><b>Controllers:</b> The routing, so usually the routes folder</li>
    <li>In the server.js file, can put "{ force: true }" inside of the sync part of require('./db').sync() at the bottom
      of the page. This dumps the table/data. Once you've done that, be sure to then take it out so it doesn't keep
      dumping your table</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Focusing on relational aspect of data</li>
    <li>Doing a pets + owners</li>
    <li>To be able to list owners before pets</li>
    <li>Then for each pet, add owner_id to give each pet an owner</li>
    <li>Foreign key = key from another table</li>
    <li>REFERENCES tableName(field to reference)</li>
    <li>FOREIGN KEY (owner_id) REFERENCES owners(id)</li>
    <li>Join Queries: 4 different types</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Can call pet id to owner id make sure they both match. Where you grab the data they have in common. "Inner
        Join" -- AKA: where you're calling where the venn diagrams overlap</li>
      <li>"Left join" --- you want everything from the table, even if it doesn't have a match (aka: if you were trying
        to match pets with owners but had some pets w/o owners....it'd give you the matches to the pets but then all the
        other pets too</li>
      <li>"Right join" --- give all owners even if they don't have pets, for owners with pets, give me their matched pet
      </li>
      <li>"Outer join" -- Give me anything that does not have a match (everything but the overlap)</li>
      <li>"Full join" -- entire venn diagram, overlap, and each individual side ---- Cannot do this one in mySQL</li>
    </ul>
    <li>mySQL doesn't let you do a full join. So use both a left join and a right join together w/ a union statement
    </li>
    <li>When selecting from a table, can use structure "owners.name AS owner" to have that data display as owner instead
      of name</li>
    <li>"left" is the "from" table, and "right" is whatever comes after the join query.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Got our Project 2 groups. Mine: Brian, Danielle, and Matthew</li>
    <li>In mySQL workbench...</li>
    <li>You RARELY delete data. Sometimes archive it. But RARE to delete table or database entirely</li>
    <li>For data value types, you can add in "UNIQUE" to make sure all data entries are unique. You can also add a
      DEFAULT 'John Doe' for example.</li>
    <li>It's generally good practice to give each table a unique ID.</li>
    <li>His repo: MYSQL001</li>
    <li>npm i mysql2</li>
    <li>to get Heroku deployed w/ database:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>create Heroku</li>
      <li>Open heroku, go to resources tab.</li>
      <li>add ons, JawsDB MySQL</li>
      <li>will ask for a cc info. But then pick free option</li>
      <li>need to use connection uri: mysql://[username for database]:[password]@[host]/[database name]</li>
      <li>Do that in in index.js: module.exports = all that. --- Then when you get it up on Heroku,there's similar info.
        Change that module exports line to "modeule.exports = mysql.createConnection(prcoess.env.JAWSDB_URL || that
        thing in the bullet above</li>

  <h1>Thursday, 8/20/2020</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Repo: mySQL001</li>
    <li>Learning 2 databases in this class: mySQL and Mongo</li>
    <li><b>My SQL</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>SQL = Structured Query Language</li>
      <li>It has rigid structure & sequence in how it operates</li>
      <li>The tools you use to speak to the database</li>
      <li>Rigidity of structure it reduces the chance of unexpected things happening in the database. Eg: you can say
        this has to be a string, can't be empty, can limit number of characters. Control case (upper/lower). Etc</li>
    </ul>
    <li>There's only a 1-2% difference between how the various databases work. They're all built on SQL. The syntax is
      almost identical between systems. So if you learn one, it's <i>really</i> easy to learn the others.</li>
    <li>Other databases are "no SQL" databases. Not using the structured method</li>
    <li>structured query languages work like a table w/ certain rows/columns</li>
    <li>Eg:</li>
    <table border="1px">
      <tr>
        <td>ID</td>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>Age</td>
        <td>Phone</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>John</td>
        <td>41</td>
        <td>555-555-5555</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <li>No SQL acts more like a bucket you just throw things into them</li>
    <li>The differences between the two are largely irrelevant now</li>
    <li>In noSQL you'd use ODM to give it some degree of structure and organization here. ODM = object document mapper
    </li>
    <li>In the past: SQL was good for big data, noSQL was typically used for simple stuff. Now the only reason we use
      SQL because people still use this out of habit. noSQL is typically easier (uses JS type synatx) and better to use.
      noSQL is the more modern way</li>
    <li>We'll use mySQL in Project 2</li>
    <li>Will learn about noSQL after Project 2</li>
    <li>mySQL = relational, noSQL = non-relational --- meaning it has to do w/ how we connect our data together.
      Relational: Connect user data to their posts for example. Non-relational: doesn't inherently have tht, but you're
      also able to use those other tools to create relationships</li>
    <li>OK....about mySQL</li>
    <li>it's a <i>new</i> language</li>
    <li>Need to do some installation of tools to make it work</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Need to install: mySQL server and mySQL workbench</li>
      <li>At one point it asks you for a password. MAKE SURE YOU WRITE IT DOWN. If you forget it, you have to totally
        reinstall everything. Everyone can have "rootroot"</li>
    </ul>
    <li>strings are not a data type in mySQL. Different syntax here. ( note the ones in the list below is supposed to be
      in caps) For SQL use:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>text</li>
      <li>blob (works same)</li>
      <li>tinytext (max length 255 char)</li>
      <li>mediumtext</li>
      <li>longtext</li>
      <li>varchar (you set max length, up to 255) -- eg: VARCHAR(25) means up to 25 characters. Always add NOT NULL ---
        so VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Number values</li>
    <ul>
      <li>int (number value. stupid crazy max in the millions)</li>
      <li>tiny int</li>
    </ul>
    <li>adding data to database</li>
    <ul>
      <li>INSERT INTO [name of table] ([which things to insert into, can list multiple separated by commas])</li>

    <li>server.js folder should only have create server, middle whatever, and the 3000 thing</li>
    <li>create routes folder: itemRoutes.js and index.js folder</li>

    <li>Types of requests</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Get requests --- e.g. get me to-do list items, and server finds the to-do list, and sends it back -- also
        known as HTTP (I think that was the abbreviation</li>
      <li>Post --- aka: makes something new</li>
      <li>Put --- e.g. mark a to-do list item as complete -- puts new data on server or modifies data on server</li>
      <li>Delete --- exactly what it sounds like, deletes data from server</li>
      <li>there's a few more, but these are the 4 main ones that we're using in this course</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Front end process of referencing the server is the AJAX and AXIOS processes, but referencing our own server now
      instead of someone else's server</li>
    <li>When a URL changes (e.g. adds "/user") is an example of routing</li>
    <li>Server side coding makes up the rules that says "when the route looks like this, give me this"</li>
    <li>Looking at the routes, this is where params and queries come into play, they write them using variables. e.g.
      stackoverflow.com/questions/{id}/{title}</li>
    <li>Q: "ok, let's go ahead and get started"</li>
    <li>creates repo exp001</li>
    <li>older version of creating routing</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Back before there were servers they could access w/ express</li>
      <li>Teach computer to talk to itself. Request (req) sent to itself and respond (res) to itself. --- local host ---
        running a server on your own device</li>
      <li>If you want, you can buy a hardware server for your home OR you can use cloud based servers --- in class,
        we're gonna use a cloud based one called Heroku (sp??)</li>
      <li>Naming of files is going to start becoming particularly important</li>
      <li>start with server.js --- note: naming it server, does not make it a server</li>
      <li>see server.js file</li>
      <li>host and server are synonyms</li>
      <li>any time you're waiting for a page to load, you're waiting on the server's response</li>
      <li>Run server using node server.js --- will run until you tell it to stop (ctrl+c twice will do that)</li>
      <li>Starting a server does NOT make a request happen. You have to run a request to your server</li>
      <li>TO do that: can use a 3rd party application (this is what we'll use: postman) OR write some front end OR type
        it into the search bar for our URL</li>
      <li>For this, type: "localhost.3000 --- if you hit enter to load it, it won't do anything w/o a request in the
        browser, but it spits a TON of data into your terminal if you console.log the request. --- can ignore most of
        it, but you need the url. Change console.log to (req.url)</li>
      <li>Note: if you changed the code while server is running, it's not gonna show till you stop/restart the server.
        Servers only work off of what the code was when you started the server</li>
      <li>using that console.log(res.url), it returns a / only. It ignores all the prefix. If you add something after
        your localhost.3000, it'll show that in the console.log. --- e.g. localhost.3000/something will return
        /something --- or localhost.3000/something/something else returns /something/something else</li>
      <li>If you add .split('/') to console log, it'll list them separately</li>

    <li><b><u>Express</u></b></li>
    <li>at some point in here </li>
    <li><a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> is a npm package</li>
    <li>We probably want to start putting files in a folder. Anything front end is usually in a "public" folder</li>
    <li><b><u>Postman</u></b></li>
    <li>for testing other methods than "get"</li>
    <li>but changing the verb doesn't necessarily change the action</li>
    <li>Nodemon -- install using "npm i -g nodemon"</li>
